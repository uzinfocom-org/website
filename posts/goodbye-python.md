As I’m ending my web posts on my website, I’d like to thank Python for my amazing childhood and say my last goodbye. I still remember those times when Python2
was not that popular and nobody cared about Python when I did. Python, you were amazing, I loved you, but the new generation destroyed you… I gonna miss ya.
Rest in peace…
